    "##### Some assumptions for the Dashboard:\n",
    "\n",
    "I have manually removed all the comments from the weather csv file.\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> Q: Converting all columns so that they use metric (International System of Units, SI) or derived units.\n",
    "    <li> A: This has been done using calculated fields and both the original as well as corrected fields are kept in the Tableau data pane.\n",
    "    <li> Q: Converting the time_hour column to date-time.\n",
    "    <li> A: In addition to converting the time_hour to datetime, its also adjusted by 1 hr (similar to task 4P)\n",
    "    <li> Q: Computing daily mean temperatures for the JFK,EWR,LGA airport.\n",
    "    <li> A: The Dashboard has two plots, one for mean temperature across all airports (TOP) and one for mean temperature specific to each airport (Bottom).\n",
    "    <li> Q: Finding and displaying the five hottest days.\n",
    "    <li> A: The top graph is used to display five hottest day (The logic is preserved to mimic task 4P, where I calculated top 5 hottest days by taking mean across all airports per day).\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Additional Features:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> The Dashboard has a filter to select the origin. This can be used to select one, two or all three airport temperatures.\n",
    "    <li> The Dashboard also has a slider to select Top 5 hottest days, by default all 5 days are marked (as a *) on the TOP graph. For convenience, I have added a third filter based on Months, by default all months are displayed, but one can only select the months of particular interest, e.g. when viewing top 5 hottest day, just select that particular month to zoom in automatically. \n",
