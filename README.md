# AISE-Toolkit

This repository is a collection of notebooks, scripts, and educational resources I've created or collected throughout my career as an AI software engineer. 

## Structure

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks focused on different domains.
- **PDFs**: Contains PDFs of assignment solutions from coursework and other sources.
- **Scripts**: Useful scripts for web development, bash scripting, and Python programming.

Each directory has its own README with more detailed information on the contents and usage instructions.
